I'm always fascinated by how many different job titles there are out there. I've a quite a few myself and I'd love to see what you actual title is and how well you think it relates to your work!

For me, I am a ***Level 3* Software Engineer**. I focus on front-end development with React, but dip into Rails every now and then. I think this title is a pretty good representation of what I actually do, but I don't believe that there is a standardization around the levels - if someone knows of one, I would love to hear about it!

Have a great weekend folks!
