Hey DEVers! As we go into 2019, I am reviewing my to-read list. 

Here are a few of my top picks that I am going to hop into soon:

- [The Mythical Man-Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959) - Frederick P. Brooks Jr.
- [The Sense of Style](https://www.amazon.com/Sense-Style-Thinking-Persons-Writing/dp/0143127799) - Steven Pinker
- [Build an A-Team](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1633693643/?coliid=I2JXIG80FWNDW9&colid=2LLLIOPZXIG8Q&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it) - Whitney Johnson
