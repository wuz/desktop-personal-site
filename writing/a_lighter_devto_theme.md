I recently saw this issue brought up on the dev.to repo review:

{% github "https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/issues/1470" %}

I thought I'd take a swing at simplifying the article theme a bit, using the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) extension. Here's where I ended up:

If you like this and want to install it, you can [find it here](https://userstyles.org/styles/167958/dev-to-simple-style)!

What do you think? What would you change?
