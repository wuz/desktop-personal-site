Hello friends!
Recently I have been looking for a way to bring together a community around topics like Javascript, getting hired as a frontend developer, and navigating your way through an ever-changing professional landscape. 

With this in mind, I am introducing "do...while" - a weekly hangout/livestream discussing Javascript, Frontend Engineering, and more!

Join us every Tuesday at 6:15 EST on Twitch or at https://dowhile.stream. Come with questions and answers! We'll work on a coding project, talk about a topic, and have some fun!

You can check out prior streams [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_u19v9pPheVbjcAH1Psm7w) and follow the stream on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/dowhilestream).
