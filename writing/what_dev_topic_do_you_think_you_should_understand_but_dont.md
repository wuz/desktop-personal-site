## Happy Friday, dev.to

Let's get introspective.

!["Too afraid to ask" meme](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/853/556/29e.gif)

We all know this situation: Someone is discussing a tech topic and, suddenly, *bam!*, they bring up monads or prototypical inheritance. Usually, we are just left there nodding along, hoping we get some time to Google that thing later. 

I'd like to know what dev-related topics you don't understand, but are too afraid to ask about. Maybe we can all learn something!

**NOTE: If you don't want to post them here, shoot me a [DM on Twitter](https://twitter.com/callmewuz)! I'll anonymize and post back here!**

I'll start this out! I don't understand the concept of monads. It's made worse by the fact that I feel like I _almost_ understand monads. Anyone want to try and tackle explaining them to me (or linking to somewhere that does), I would really appreciate it!
