Hey folks! I love the resolutions that are going around here and I thought I would do my own! I'm only a month late, so we are off to a good start... ðŸ¤£ First off, I wanna point out this great post by Frederik:

{% devto "_bigblind/new-years-resolutions-suck-pick-a-theme-of-the-year-2kh1" %}

I love the idea and I want to try it out. So without further ado, my 2019 theme is:

# Principals

I've been a developer for a while now. I've worked a few different types of jobs mostly in consulting or on a product team. One thing I am starting to realize is that good development starts with good principals. I'm still working on refining and discovering what all of those principals are, but here are a few that I am currently pursuing.

### General

1. Continuous metrics drive continuous improvement
2. Opinions are not facts.
3. Don't blame, fix.

### Code

1. Don't make your code do too much.
2. You can't fix code by staring at it.
3. [Write Everything Twice](https://dev.to/wuz/stop-trying-to-be-so-dry-instead-write-everything-twice-wet-5g33)
4. Always comment your abstractions
5. Optimize for deletion

### Writing

1. Write for yourself, edit for your reader

### Relationships

1. Close the loop. Don't let connections fall off. 

### Mentorship

1. A mentor will share their experiences with you to contribute to your knowledge base.
2. A mentor will use their network to help you succeed to achieve your goals.


### Some other goals

1. Write on dev.to at least once a week
2. Speak at a tech conference
3. Release some work on a side project I have been developing
4. Release 3 series around learning to be a developer (First one is being written now!)
