[RunCLI](https://runc.li) let's you easily share commands with a URL. It's really basic right now - just paste a command in the textbox and click "Create". The main use case is for apps like Twitter, where sharing a medium-sized CLI command is difficult to do well.

Here is an example with a Git command:

I probably won't add a lot more to this, but I'd love to know what you would like to see it do!
