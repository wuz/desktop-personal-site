I spend a _lot_ of time on the computer. Like 16 hours a day sometimes. I know that isn't great for my health, but I don't have a lot to do that isn't playing games, coding, or watching Netflix. 

As such, I am looking for a new hobby. What kind of stuff do you like to do that doesn't involve a computer?
