Hey friends! I am Conlin, a software engineer that lives in Indianapolis. I think I've got a good perspective on tech outside of the Valley and away from the coasts.

I've been a developer for a while, depending on how you count. I got paid to write code for the first time almost 10 years ago. I studied Economics in college with a minor in Computer Science and (almost) one in Sociology.

I've worked lots of different kinds of jobs, from consulting to a small dev team, to now working at a rather large "scale-up" company.

Let's do this!
