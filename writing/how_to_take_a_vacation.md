title: "How to take a vacation"
---
Hey all! I just got back from a vacation to Nashville, TN. It's the first one I've taken in a while and I had some thoughts on disconnecting from work and everything else while getting the most out of a trip (or stay-cation!) I am not great at stepping away, but it was quite nice.

# Step One - Get things ready to go

The key to having a good vacation that doesn't have work-creep is leaving things in a good place. I'm lucky enough to have a great team that helped take over some of my work on my days away, but even if you don't there are a few things you can do to make it a bit smoother. First and foremost, make sure you push your changes in Git. That way you can _show_ your team the status of what you have been working on. Leave a few comments on the PR and drop a line in Slack about where you are pausing on progress. Then, message your teammates to determine steps forward - can they pick up the feature where you left off or does the timeline need to change to accommodate for your departure? If someone is going to be picking it up, make sure you leave the PR in a good place - document what next steps you are thinking about taking, leave some notes as to the general quality of the code you have already written. If there are any big considerations that still need to be made, leave some notes on what you are thinking and why. Give them some alternatives to consider.
