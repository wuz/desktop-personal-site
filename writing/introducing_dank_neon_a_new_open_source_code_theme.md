Hello friends! I have an exciting new project to share with you! For the past few months, [a friend](https://twitter.com/__jacobi) and I have been tweaking and refining [Dank Neon](https://dankneon.com), a new editor theme for lovers of neon! 

We are working hard to get the community built out and would love any input and contributions that you have! The whole project is open source and you can find it [here on Github](https://github.com/DankNeon). I'll be spending some time soon to set up some good first issues and making a list of next steps! Here are some screenshots of Dank Neon in action:

What do you think about the theme? What do you like? What do you hate? What tools should we look at adding the theme to?
