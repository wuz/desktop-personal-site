Hey there, friends. Happy International Women's Day! This isn't about me, so here are some great women to follow and learn from. 

I really hope this doesn't come across like this, but I would be remiss to not share this tweet:

That's not my goal at all, I am just very lucky to follow/know all of these people and others would be too! 


> Note: This is by no means a comprehensive list. There are many, many great women out there and I could never create a list of them all.

## Ali

Mayuko is one of my favorite Youtubers! Her content is so inspiring and her editing style is wonderful. I highly recommend [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lncbay-6HYU&t=441s) - it has a great tone and the message is wonderful!

## Tae'lur

I went to college with Kim! I love following her twitter and blog. She posts great content - a lot of which has a focus on women in tech!


## My advice for fellow allies is...
1. Listen to women. It's literally the easiest thing to do.
2. Believe women. I know you might not understand their situation, but I guarantee they aren't lying.
3. Support women. Recommend them for speaking gigs, promotions, literally anything you would recommend a man for.
4. List your pronouns. This helps all sorts of people, but it normalizes the idea of personal pronouns, which is super important.
